            <p>My interest in web development started back in 2021 when I was working with Hotmart online courses and I had to configure my first webpage by using WordPress. Even though I had no idea back then on how it worked, those were my first contact with HTML & CSS!</p>
            <p>Fast-forward to today, and Iâ€™ve had the privilege of working at <a href="https://www.microverse.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Microverse</a> with several other applicants from all around the globe and very different cultures! My main focus these days is building accessible, inclusive products and digital experiences so I can improve my skills everyday.</p>
